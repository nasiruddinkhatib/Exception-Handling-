# Exception-Handling-
Exception/error Handling 
Exception handling in Python is done using the try, except, else, and finally blocks. Here's a breakdown of each:

try block: Contains code that might raise an exception.
except block: Catches and handles exceptions that occur in the try block.
else block: Executes if no exception occurs in the try block.
finally block: Executes no matter what (whether an exception occurs or not), and is typically used for clean-up actions.
